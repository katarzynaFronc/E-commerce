## Introduction

This is e-commerce application, a one-stop-shop for all your shopping needs. You can sort, filter, and search products.
Our product page is designed to provide detailed information about each product.
One of the key features of this e-commerce application is the guest checkout option. This allows you to complete your purchase without having to create an account, making the checkout process faster and less tedious. Payment is handled securely via card transactions, ensuring that your financial information is protected at all times. 
Our application is designed with a user-centric approach, focusing on providing an intuitive shopping experience.

## Build with

1.Frontend:

This application I wrote in React / TypeScript. I used Next.js framework which allows using client-side components using the use client directive. 
I used Bootstrap framework and its initial components to create a responsive application. In this application, Bootstrap is used in combination with React-Bootstrap. I also used the Sass preprocessor to adapt the default Bootstrap styles to the app design.

2.Backend:

I used the Sanity Studio app to collaborate on real-time content creation. The schemas are defined using JavaScript objects. 

Payments are handled by the Stripe platform. For testing, you can use any card number from the list https://stripe.com/docs/testing#cards
